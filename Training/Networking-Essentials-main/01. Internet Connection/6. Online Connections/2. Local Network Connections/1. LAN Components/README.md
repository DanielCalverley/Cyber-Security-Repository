# LAN Components

- In addition to smart phones and mobile devices, there are many other components that can be part of a local area network.
- Some examples of network components are personal computers, servers, networking devices, and cabling.
- These components can be grouped into four main categories:

   - Hosts
   - Peripherals
   - Network devices
   - Network media

## Hosts

- Hosts send and receive user traffic.
- A host is a generic name for most end-user devices.
- A host has an IP address.
- Examples of hosts are personal computers and network attached printers.

## Peripherals

- Shared peripheral devices do not communicate directly on the network. 
- Instead, peripherals rely on their connected host to perform all network operations.
- Examples of shared peripherals are cameras, scanners, and locally attached printers.

## Network Devices

- Networking devices connect other devices, mainly hosts.
- These devices move and control network traffic. 
- Examples of network devices include hubs, switches, and routers.

## Network Media

- Network media provides connections between hosts and network devices.
- Network media can be wired, such as copper and fiber optic, or use wireless technologies.

## Additional Info.

- The network components that you are probably most familiar with are hosts and shared peripherals. 
- Remember that hosts are any devices that send and receive messages directly across the network.
- Shared peripherals are not directly connected to the network, but instead are connected to hosts.
- The host is then responsible for sharing the peripheral across the network.
- Hosts have software configured to enable people on the network to use the attached peripheral devices.
- The network devices, as well as the networking media, are used to interconnect hosts.
- Networking devices are sometimes referred to as “intermediary devices” because they are usually located in the path that messages take between a source host and a destination host.
- The term network media describes the cables and wires used in wired networks, along with radio frequency waves used in wireless networks.
- These wired and wireless networks provide the paths over which messages travel between the various network components.
- Some devices can play more than one role, depending on how they are connected.
- For example, a printer that is directly connected to a host (local printer) is a peripheral. 
- A printer that is directly connected to a network device and participates directly in network communications is a host.

## Ethernet

- Ethernet is technology commonly used in local area networks.
- Developed at Xerox PARC, Ethernet was commercially introduced in 1980 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Intel, and Xerox. 
- Ethernet was later standardized in 1983 as IEEE 802.3.
- Devices access the Ethernet LAN using an Ethernet Network Interface Card (NIC).
- Each Ethernet NIC has a unique address permanently embedded on the card known as a Media Access Control (MAC) address.
