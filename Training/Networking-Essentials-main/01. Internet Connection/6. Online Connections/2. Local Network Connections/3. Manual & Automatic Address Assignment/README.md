# Manual IP Configuration

- With manual configuration, the required values are entered into the device via the keyboard, typically by a network administrator.
- The IP address that is entered is referred to as a static address and and must be unique on the network.

# Dynamic IP Configuration

- Most end-user devices can be set up to receive network configuration information dynamically. 
- This enables the device to request an address from a pool of addresses assigned by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server located within the network.
