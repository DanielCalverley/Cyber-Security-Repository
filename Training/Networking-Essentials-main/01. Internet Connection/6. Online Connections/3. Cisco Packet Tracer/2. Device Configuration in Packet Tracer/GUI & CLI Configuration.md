# GUI and CLI Configuration

- Packet Tracer also provides a variety of tabs for device configuration including the following:
  - Physical
  - Config
  - CLI
  - Desktop
  - Services

## 1. Physical Tab: 
- The Physical tab provides an interface for interacting with the device including powering it on or off or installing different modules, such as a wireless network interface card (NIC).
## 2. Config Tab: 
- For intermediate devices such as routers and switches, there are two methods of configuration available:
  - Devices can be configured or investigated via a Config tab (a GUI interface)
  - Command line interface (CLI)
- The Config tab does not provide a real world environment. This tab is a learning tab in Packet Tracer.
- If you don’t know how to use the command line interface, this tab provides a way to “fill in the blank” to do basic configurations.
- It will show the equivalent CLI commands that perform the same action if someone was configuring using the CLI tab.
- The *Equivalent IOS* Commands window shows the command that would achieve the same results in the CLI.
## 3. CLI:
- The CLI tab provides access to the CLI interface, which requires knowledge of device configuration.
- Here, you can practice configuring the device at the command line.
- CLI configuration is a necessary skill for more advanced networking implementations.
- **Note:** Any commands that were entered from the Config tab are also shown here in the CLI tab.
## 4. Desktop:
- For some of the end devices, such as PCs and laptops, Packet Tracer provides a desktop interface that gives you access to IP configuration, wireless configuration, a command prompt, a web browser, and much more.
## 5. Sevices:
- If you are configuring a server, the server has all of the functions of a host with the addition of one more tab, the Services tab.
- This tab allows a server to be configured as a web server, a DHCP server, a DNS server, or various other servers visible in the graphic.
