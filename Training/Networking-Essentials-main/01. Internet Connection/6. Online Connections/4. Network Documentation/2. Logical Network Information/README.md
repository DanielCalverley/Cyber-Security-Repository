# Logical Network Information

- Documenting the physical connections and devices in your network will provide you with the information that you need to know when connecting new devices or finding problems with broken connectivity.
- But there is other information that you must have when troubleshooting network problems. This information cannot be “seen” from the physical view of the network.
- The device names, IP addressing, configuration information, and network designations are logical pieces of information that may change more frequently than the physical connectivity.
- A diagram called a logical topology illustrates the relevant network configuration information.
