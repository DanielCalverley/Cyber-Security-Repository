# Device Names & Addressing

- Computer operating systems such as Microsoft Windows allow the naming of a device such as a computer or a printer. 
- Device names must be unique and should have a consistent format that conveys meaningful information.
- This can help to determine device type, function, location, and sequence number based on the device name.
- IP addresses must also be unique to each device.
- The use of logical device naming and addressing conventions that are well documented can greatly simplify the task of training and network management and can help as well with troubleshooting when problems arise.
