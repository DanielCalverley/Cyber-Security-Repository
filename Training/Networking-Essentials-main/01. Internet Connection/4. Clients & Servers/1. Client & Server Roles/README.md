# Client and Server Roles

## Hosts

- All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts. 
- Hosts can send and receive messages on the network.
- In modern networks, computer hosts can act as a client, a server, or both, as shown in the figure. 
- The software installed on the computer determines which role the computer plays.

## Servers

- Servers are hosts that have software installed which enable them to provide information, like email or web pages, to other hosts on the network. 
- Each service requires separate server software. 
- For example, a host requires web server software in order to provide web services to the network.
- Every destination that you visit online is provided to you by a server located somewhere on a network that is connected to the global internet.

## Clients

- Clients are computer hosts that have software installed that enables the hosts to request and display the information obtained from the server. 
- An example of client software is a web browser, such as Internet Explorer, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, or Chrome.
