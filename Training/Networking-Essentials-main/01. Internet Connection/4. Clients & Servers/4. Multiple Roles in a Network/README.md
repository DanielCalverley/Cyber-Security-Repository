- Additionally, a single computer can run multiple types of server software. In a home or small business, it may be necessary for one computer to act as a file server, a web server, and an email server.
- A single computer can also run multiple types of client software. 
- There must be client software for every service required. 
- With multiple clients installed, a host can connect to multiple servers at the same time. 
- For example, a user can check email and view a web page while instant messaging and listening to internet radio.
