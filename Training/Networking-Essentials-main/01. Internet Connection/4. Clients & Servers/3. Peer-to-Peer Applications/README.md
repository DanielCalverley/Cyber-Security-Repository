# Peer-to-Peer Applications

- A P2P application allows a device to act as both a client and a server within the same communication, as shown in the figure.
- In this model, every client is a server and every server is a client.
- P2P applications require that each end device provide a user interface and run a background service.

- Both clients can simultaneously send and receive messages.
- Some P2P applications use a hybrid system where resource sharing is decentralized, but the indexes that point to resource locations are stored in a centralized directory. 
- In a hybrid system, each peer accesses an index server to get the location of a resource stored on another peer.
