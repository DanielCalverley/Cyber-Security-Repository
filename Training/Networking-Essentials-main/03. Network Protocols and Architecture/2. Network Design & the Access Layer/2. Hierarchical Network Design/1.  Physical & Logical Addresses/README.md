# Physical & Logical Addresses

- On a host, the MAC address does not change; it is physically assigned to the host NIC and is known as the physical address.
- The physical address remains the same regardless of where the host is placed on the network.
- The IP address is similar to the address of a person. It is known as a logical address because it is assigned logically based on where the host is located.
- The IP address, or network address, is assigned to each host by a network administrator based on the local network.
- IP addresses contain two parts. One part identifies the network portion.
- The network portion of the IP address will be the same for all hosts connected to the same local network.
- The second part of the IP address identifies the individual host on that network.
- Within the same local network, the host portion of the IP address is unique to each host, as shown in the figure.
- Both the physical MAC and logical IP addresses are required for a computer to communicate on a hierarchical network, just like both the name and address of a person are required to send a letter.
