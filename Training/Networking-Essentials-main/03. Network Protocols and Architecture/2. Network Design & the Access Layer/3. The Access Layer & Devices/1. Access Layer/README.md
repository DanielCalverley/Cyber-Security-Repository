# The Access Layer

- The access layer is the basic level of the network.
- It is the part of the network in which people gain access to other hosts and to shared files and printers.
- The access layer provides the first line of networking devices that connect hosts to the wired Ethernet network.
- Networking devices enable us to connect many hosts with each other and also provide those hosts access to services offered over the network.
- Unlike the simple network consisting of two hosts connected by a single cable, in the access layer, each host is connected to a networking device.
- Within an Ethernet network, each host is able to connect directly to an access layer networking device using an Ethernet cable.
- These cables are manufactured to meet specific Ethernet standards.
- Each cable is plugged into a host NIC and then into a port on the networking device.
- There are several types of networking devices that can be used to connect hosts at the access layer, including Ethernet switches.
