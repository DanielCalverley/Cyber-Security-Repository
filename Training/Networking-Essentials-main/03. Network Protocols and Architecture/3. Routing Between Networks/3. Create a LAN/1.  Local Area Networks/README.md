# The LAN

- The term local area network (LAN) refers to a local network, or a group of interconnected local networks that are under the same administrative control.
- In the early days of networking, LANs were defined as small networks that existed in a single physical location.
- Although LANs can be a single local network installed in a home or small office, the definition of LAN has evolved to include interconnected local networks consisting of many hundreds of hosts, installed in multiple buildings and locations.
- The important thing to remember is that all the local networks within a LAN are under one administrative control.
- Other common characteristics of LANs are that they typically use Ethernet or wireless protocols, and they support high data rates.
- The term intranet is often used to refer to a private LAN that belongs to an organization, and is designed to be accessible only by the members of the organization, employees, or others with authorization.
