# The 3 Elements

- All communication methods have three elements in common. 

- `The first` of these elements is the message source, or sender.
- Message sources are people, or electronic devices, that need to communicate a message to other individuals or devices.

- `The second` element of communication is the destination, or receiver, of the message.
- The destination receives the message and interprets it. 
- `The third` element is called a transmission medium, or channel.
- It provides the pathway over which the message can travel from source to destination.
