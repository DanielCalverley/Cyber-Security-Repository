# Ethernet Evolution

- The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, or IEEE (pronounced eye-triple-e), maintains the networking standards, including Ethernet and wireless standards. 

- IEEE committees are responsible for approving and maintaining the standards for connections, media requirements and communications protocols. 

- Each technology standard is assigned a number that refers to the committee that is responsible for approving and maintaining the standard. 
- The committee responsible for the Ethernet standards is 802.3.

- Since the creation of Ethernet in 1973, standards have evolved for specifying faster and more flexible versions of the technology. 
- This ability for Ethernet to improve over time is one of the main reasons that it has become so popular. 
- Each version of Ethernet has an associated standard. 
- For example, 802.3 100BASE-T represents the 100 Megabit Ethernet using twisted-pair cable standards. 

**The standard notation translates as:**

    100 is the speed in 
    
    BASE stands for baseband transmission
    
    T stands for the type of cable, in this case, twisted-pair
    
- Early versions of Ethernet were relatively slow at 10 Mbps. 
- The latest versions of Ethernet operate at 10 Gigabits per second and more. 
- Imagine how much faster these new versions are than the original Ethernet networks.
