# The Rise of Ethernet

- In the early days of networking, each vendor used its own proprietary methods of interconnecting network devices and networking protocols. 
- If you bought equipment from different vendors, there was no guarantee that the equipment would work together. 
- Equipment from one vendor might not communicate with equipment from another.

- As networks became more widespread, standards were developed that defined rules by which network equipment from different vendors operated. 

**Standards are beneficial to networking in many ways:**

    Facilitate design
    
    Simplify product development
    
    Promote competition
    
    Provide consistent interconnections
    
    Facilitate training
    
    Provide more vendor choices for customers

- There is no official local area networking standard protocol, but over time, one technology, Ethernet, has become more common than the others. 

- Ethernet protocols define how data is formatted and how it is transmitted over the wired network. 
- The Ethernet standards specify protocols that operate at Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the OSI model. 
- Ethernet has become a de facto standard, which means that it is the technology used by almost all wired local area networks, as shown in the figure.
