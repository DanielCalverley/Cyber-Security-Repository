# Network Standard Orgs

- An internet standard is the end result of a comprehensive cycle of discussion, problem solving, and testing. 
- These different standards are developed, published, and maintained by a variety of organizations.
- When a new standard is proposed, each stage of the development and approval process is recorded in a numbered Request for Comments (RFC) document so that the evolution of the standard is tracked.
- RFCs for internet standards are published and managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
- Other standards organizations that support the internet are IEEE, IANA, ICANN, ITU, etc.
