# The TCP/IP Model

- Layered models help us visualize how the various protocols work together to enable network communications. 

- A layered model depicts the operation of the protocols occurring within each layer, as well as the interaction with the layers above and below it. 
- The layered model has many benefits:

    1. Assists in protocol design, because protocols that operate at a specific layer have defined information that they act upon and a defined interface to the layers above          and below.
    2. Fosters competition because products from different vendors can work together.
    3. Enables technology changes to occur at one level without affecting the other levels.
    4. Provides a common language to describe networking functions and capabilities.

- The first layered model for internetwork communications was created in the early 1970s and is referred to as the internet model. 
- It defines four categories of functions that must occur in order for communications to be successful. 
- The suite of TCP/IP protocols that are used for internet communications follows the structure of this model, as shown in the figure. 
- Because of this, the internet model is commonly referred to as the TCP/IP model.


| TCP/IP Model Layer | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Application | Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control |
| Transport | Supports communication between various devices across diverse networks |
| Internet | Determines the best path through the network |
| Network Access | Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network |
