# Purpose of the IPv4 Address

- A host needs an IPv4 address to participate on the internet and almost all LANs today.
- The IPv4 address is a logical network address that identifies a particular host.
- It must be properly configured and unique within the LAN, for local communication.
- It must also be properly configured and unique in the world, for remote communication.
- This is how a host is able to communicate with other devices on the internet.
- An IPv4 address is assigned to the network interface connection for a host.
- This connection is usually a network interface card (NIC) installed in the device.
- Examples of end-user devices with network interfaces include workstations, servers, network printers, and IP phones.
- Some servers can have more than one NIC and each of these has its own IPv4 address.
- Router interfaces that provide connections to an IP network will also have an IPv4 address.
- Every packet sent across the internet has a source and destination IPv4 address. 
- This information is required by networking devices to ensure the information gets to the destination and any replies are returned to the source.
