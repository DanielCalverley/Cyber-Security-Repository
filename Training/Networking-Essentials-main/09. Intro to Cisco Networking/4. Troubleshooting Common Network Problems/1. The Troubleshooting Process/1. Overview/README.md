# Troubleshooting Overview

- Troubleshooting is the process of identifying, locating and correcting problems. 

- Experienced individuals often rely on instinct to troubleshoot. 

- However, there are structured techniques that can be used to determine the most probable cause and solution.

- When troubleshooting, proper documentation must be maintained. 

- This documentation should include as much information as possible about the following:

  - The problem encountered
  - Steps taken to determine the cause of the problem
  - Steps to correct the problem and ensure that it will not reoccur

- Document all steps taken in troubleshooting, even the ones that did not solve the issue. 

- This documentation becomes a valuable reference should the same or similar problem occur again.

- Even in a small home network, good documentation saves hours of trying to remember how a problem was fixed in the past.
