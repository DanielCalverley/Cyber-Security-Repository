# Connect More Devices

- Home and small business networks usually do not require more than one or two networking devices in order to function efficiently. 

- A wireless router, equipped with wireless connections and a few wired connections, is the only piece of networking equipment that is necessary in order to provide sufficient connectivity for the average small group of users. 
- These routers are configured through a web browser and have an easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI) that guides you through the most common configuration items.

- Wireless routers that are designed primarily for home use are not appropriate for most business networks that must support more than a few users. 
- Modern networks use a variety of devices for connectivity. 
- Each device has certain capabilities for controlling the flow of data across a network. 
- A general rule is that the higher the device is in the OSI model, the more intelligent it is. 

- What this means is that a higher level device can better analyze the data traffic and forward it based on information not available at lower layers. 
- As an example, a Layer 2 switch can filter the data and send it only out of the port that is connected to the destination, based on the MAC address.

- As switches and routers evolve, the distinction between them may seem blurred. 

**One simple distinction remains:**

  1. LAN switches provide connectivity within the local-area networks of the organization, while routers interconnect local networks and are needed in a wide area network (WAN) environment.
  
  2. In other words, a switch is used to connect devices on the same network. 
  3. A router is used to connect multiple networks to each other.

- In addition to switches and routers, there are other connectivity options available for LANs. 
- Wireless access points that are deployed in enterprises enable computers and other devices, such as IP phones, to wirelessly connect to the network, or share broadband connectivity. 

- Firewalls guard against network threats and provide security, network control, and containment.
