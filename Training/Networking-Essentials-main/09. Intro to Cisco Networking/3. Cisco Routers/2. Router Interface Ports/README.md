# Router Interface Ports

- Although there are several different types and models of routers, every Cisco router has the same general hardware components.

- The figure shows a Cisco 4321 Integrated Services Router (ISR). The router includes the following connections:

    - **Console ports -** Two console ports for the initial configuration and command-line interface (CLI) management access using a regular RJ-45 port and a USB Type-B (mini-B USB) connector.
    
    - **Two LAN interfaces -** Two Gigabit Ethernet interfaces for LAN access labeled GE 0/0/0 and GE 0/0/1. The GE 0/0/0 port can be accessed through an RJ-45 connection or by using a small form-factor pluggable (SFP) attachment to provide a fiber-optics connection.
    - **Network Interface Modules (NIMs) -** Two NIM expansion slots that provide modularity and flexibility by enabling the router to support different types of interface modules, including serial, digital subscriber line (DSL), switch ports, and wireless.

- The Cisco 4321 ISR also has a USB port, a management interface, and an auxiliary port. 
- The USB port can be use for file transfers. 
- The management port can be used for remote management access when the two Gigabit Ethernet interfaces are unavailable. 
- The auxiliary port provides legacy support for a method for connecting a dial-up modem to the router for remote access. 

- The auxiliary port is rarely used in networks today.
