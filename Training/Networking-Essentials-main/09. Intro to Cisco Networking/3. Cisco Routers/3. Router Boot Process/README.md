# Management Ports

- Similar to a Cisco switch, there are several ways to access the command line interface on a Cisco router. 
 
- The most common methods are as follows :

    - **Console:** Uses a low speed serial or USB connection to provide direct connect, out-of-band management access to a Cisco device.
    - **SSH:** Method for remotely accessing a CLI session across an active network interface, including the management interface.
    
    - **AUX port:** Used for remote management of the router using a dial-up telephone line and modem.

- The console port is a physical port located on the router. 
- When using SSH, there must be an active network interface that is configured with a valid IP address for the network. 
- This can be one of the active network interfaces used for network traffic or it can be the management interface.

## Management Configuration Access

- In addition to these management ports, routers also have network interfaces to receive and forward IP packets. 
- Most routers have multiple interfaces that are used to connect to multiple networks. 
 
- Typically, the interfaces connect to various types of networks, as shown in the figure, which means that different types of media and connectors are required.
