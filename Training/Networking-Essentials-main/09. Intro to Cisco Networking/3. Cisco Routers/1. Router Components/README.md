# Router Components

- Regardless of their function, size, or complexity, all router models are essentially computers. Just like computers, tablets, and smart devices, routers also require the following:

    - Operating system **(OS)**
    - Central processing unit **(CPU)**
    - Random-access memory **(RAM)**
    - Read-only memory **(ROM)**
    - Nonvolatile random-access memory **(NVRAM)**

- Like all computers, tablets, and smart devices, Cisco routers require a CPU to execute OS instructions, such as system initialization, routing functions, and switching functions.

- The CPU requires an OS to provide routing and switching functions. 
- The Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) is the system software used for most Cisco devices, regardless of the size and type of the device. 
- It is used for routers, LAN switches, small wireless access points, large routers with dozens of interfaces, and many other devices.
