# Antispam Software

- No one likes opening their email and being overwhelmed by unwanted messages. 
- Spam is not only annoying; it can overload email servers and potentially carry viruses and other security threats. 
- Additionally, people who send spam may use links within the emails to take control of a host by planting code on it in the form of a virus or a Trojan horse. 
- The host is then used to send spam mail without the knowledge of the user, consuming the local bandwidth and processor resources.

- Antispam software protects hosts by identifying spam and performing an action, such as placing it into a junk folder or deleting it. 
- Spam filters can be loaded on individual devices, but can also be loaded on email servers. 
- In addition, many ISPs offer spam filters. 
- Antispam software does not recognize all spam, so it is important to open email carefully. 
- It may also accidentally identify wanted email as spam and treat it as such.
