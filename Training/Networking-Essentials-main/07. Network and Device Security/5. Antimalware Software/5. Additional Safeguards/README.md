# Additional Safeguards

- One of the most common types of spam forwarded is a virus warning. 
 
- Although some virus warnings sent via email are true, a large number of them are hoaxes and do not really exist. 
- This type of spam can create problems because people warn others of the impending disaster and so flood the email system. 
- In addition, network administrators may overreact and waste time investigating a problem that does not exist. 
- Finally, many of these emails can actually contribute to the spread of viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.

- In addition to using spam blockers, other actions to prevent the spread of spam include the following:

   1. Apply OS and application updates when available.
   2. Run an antivirus program regularly and keep it up to date.
   3. Do not forward suspicious emails.
   4. Do not open email attachments, especially from people you do not know.
   5. Set up rules in your email to delete spam that bypass the antispam software.
   6. Identify sources of spam and report it to a network administrator so it can be blocked.
   
   7. Report incidents to the governmental agency that deals with abuse by spam.
