# Signs of Infection

- Even when the OS and applications have all the current patches and updates, they may still be susceptible to attack. 
- Any device that is connected to a network is susceptible to viruses, worms, and Trojan horses. 
- These may be used to corrupt OS code, affect computer performance, alter applications, and destroy data. 
- So how do you know if your computer has been infected?

- Some of the signs that a virus, worm, or Trojan horse may be present include the following:

   1. Computer starts acting abnormally
   2. Program does not respond to mouse and keystrokes
   3. Programs starting or shutting down on their own
   4. Email program begins sending out large quantities of email
   5. CPU usage is very high
   6. There are unidentifiable processes or a large number of processes running
   7. Computer slows down significantly or crashes, such as the when the Windows “blue screen of death” (BSoD) appears, as shown in the figure.

- Antimalware includes a variety of software available to detect and prevent these types of intrusions and infections including antivirus software, antispam software, and antispyware software.
