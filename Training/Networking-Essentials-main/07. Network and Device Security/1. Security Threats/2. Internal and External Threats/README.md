## External Threats

- External threats arise from individuals working outside of an organization. 
- They do not have authorized access to the computer systems or network. 

- External attackers work their way into a network mainly from the internet through wireless links or dialup access servers.


## Internal Threats

- Internal threats occur when someone has authorized access to the network through a user account, or has physical access to the network equipment. 
- Internal attackers know the internal politics and people. 
- They often know what information is both valuable and vulnerable, and how to get to it.

- However, not all internal attacks are intentional. 
- In some cases, an internal threat can come from a trustworthy employee who picks up a virus or security threat while outside the company and unknowingly brings it into the internal network.

- Most companies spend considerable resources defending against external attacks, however; some of the most damaging incidents are the result of actions by trusted internal users. 
- Lost smart phones and removable storage devices, misplaced or stolen laptops, and the failure to properly remove data from devices before disposal are common ways that user data ends up in the hands of the wrong people.
