# Types of Threats

- Whether wired or wireless, computer networks are essential to everyday activities. 

- Individuals and organizations alike depend on their computers and networks for functions such as email, accounting, organization, and file management. 
- Intrusion by an unauthorized person can result in costly network outages and loss of work. 
- Attacks to a network can be devastating and can result in a loss of time and money due to damage or theft of important information or assets.

- Intruders can gain access to a network through software vulnerabilities, hardware attacks, or even through less high-tech methods, such as guessing usernames and passwords. - Intruders who gain access by modifying software or exploiting software vulnerabilities are often called threat actors.

- When the threat actor gains access to the network, four types of threat may arise: 


### 1. Information Theft

- Information theft is breaking into a computer to obtain confidential information. 

- Information can be used or sold for various purposes such as when someone is stealing proprietary information of an organization, like research and development data. 

### 2. Data Loss and Manipulation

- Data loss and manipulation is breaking into a computer to destroy or alter data records.
- An example of data loss is a threat actor sending a virus that reformats a computer hard drive. 

- An example of data manipulation is breaking into a records system to change information, such as the price of an item.

### 3. Identity Theft

- Identity theft is a form of information theft where personal information is stolen for the purpose of taking over the identity of someone. 
- Using this information, a threat actor can obtain legal documents, apply for credit, and make unauthorized online purchases. 
- Identify theft is a growing problem costing billions of dollars per year. 

### 4. Disruption of Service

- Disruption of service is preventing legitimate users from accessing services to which they are entitled. 
- Examples include denial of service (DoS) attacks on servers, network devices, or network communications links.
