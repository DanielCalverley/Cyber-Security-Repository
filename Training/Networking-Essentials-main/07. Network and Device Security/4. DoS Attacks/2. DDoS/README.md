# Background

- DoS attacks that are coming from a single IP address can disrupt a website for a period of time until the attack can be isolated and defended against. 

- More sophisticated types of attacks can bring web services offline for much longer lengths of time.

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 

- DDoS is a more sophisticated and potentially damaging form of the DoS attack. 
- It is designed to saturate and overwhelm network links with useless data. 
- DDoS operates on a much larger scale than DoS attacks. 
- Typically hundreds or thousands of attack points attempt to overwhelm a target simultaneously. 
- The attack points may be unsuspecting computers that have been previously infected by the DDoS code. 
- The systems that are infected with the DDoS code attack the target site when invoked. 
 
- This group of infected computers is often called a botnet.

## Brute Force 

- Not all attacks that cause network outages are specifically DoS attacks. 
- A brute force attack is another type of attack that may result in denial of services.

- With brute force attacks, a fast computer is used to try to guess passwords or to decipher an encryption code. 
- The attacker tries a large number of possibilities in rapid succession to gain access or crack the code. 
- Brute force attacks can cause a denial of service due to excessive traffic to a specific resource, or by locking out user accounts.
