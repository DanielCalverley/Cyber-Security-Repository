# Spyware

- Not all attacks do damage or prevent legitimate users from having access to resources. 
- Many threats are designed to collect information about users which can be used for advertising, marketing, and research purposes. 
- These include spyware, tracking cookies, adware, and popups. 
- While these may not damage a computer, they invade privacy and can be annoying.

- **Spyware** is any program that gathers personal information from your computer without your permission or knowledge. 
- This information is sent to advertisers or others on the internet and can include passwords and account numbers.

- Spyware is usually installed unknowingly when downloading a file, installing another program, or clicking a popup. 
- It can slow down a computer and make changes to internal settings which creates more vulnerabilities for other threats. 
- In addition, spyware can be very difficult to remove.

## Tracking Cookies

- Cookies are a form of spyware but are not always bad. 
- They are used to record information about an internet user when the user visits websites. 
- Cookies may be useful or desirable by allowing personalization and other time saving techniques. 

- Many websites require that cookies be enabled in order to allow the user to connect.
