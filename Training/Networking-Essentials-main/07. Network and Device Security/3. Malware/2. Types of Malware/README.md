# Types of Malware

## 1. Viruses 

- A virus is a program that spreads by modifying other programs or files. 
- A virus cannot start by itself; it needs to be activated. 
- When activated, a virus may do nothing more than replicate itself and spread. 
- Though simple, even this type of virus is dangerous as it can quickly use all available memory and bring a system to a halt. 
- A more serious virus may be programmed to delete or corrupt specific files before spreading. 
- Viruses can be transmitted via email, downloaded files, and instant messages, or via CD or USB devices.

## 2. Worms 

- A worm is similar to a virus, but unlike a virus, it does not need to attach itself to an existing program. 
- A worm uses the network to send copies of itself to any connected hosts. 
- Worms can run independently and spread quickly. 
- They do not necessarily require activation or human intervention. 
- Self-spreading network worms can have a much greater impact than a single virus and can infect large parts of the internet quickly.

## 3. Trojan Horses 

- A Trojan horse is a program that is written to appear like a legitimate program, when in fact it is an attack tool. 
- It cannot replicate itself. 
- A Trojan horse relies upon its legitimate appearance to deceive the victim into initiating the program. 
- It may be relatively harmless or may contain code that can damage the hard drive content of the computer. 
- Trojans can also create a back door into a system that then allows threat actors to gain access.
