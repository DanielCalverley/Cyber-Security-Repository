# Malicious Software

- In addition to social engineering, there are other types of attacks launched by malicious software which exploit the vulnerabilities in computer software. 
- Malware is the short name for malicious software.

- Examples of malware attacks include viruses, worms, and Trojan horses. 
- All of these are types of malware introduced onto a host. 
- They can damage a system, destroy data, as well as deny access to networks, systems, or services. 
- They can also forward data and personal details from unsuspecting PC users to criminals. 
- In many cases, they can replicate themselves and spread to other hosts connected to the network. 
- Imagine how difficult it would be to recreate saved files, such as game files, license key files, photographs, and videos.

- Sometimes these techniques are used in combination with social engineering to trick an unsuspecting user into executing the attack.
