# Botnets and Zombies

- Another annoying by-product of our increasing reliance on electronic communications is unwanted bulk email. 
- Sometimes merchants do not want to bother with targeted marketing. 
- They want to send their email advertising to as many end users as possible hoping that someone is interested in their product or service. 
- This widely distributed approach to marketing on the internet is called spam. 
- One of the ways that spam can be sent is by using a botnet or bot.

- "Bot" is derived from the word "robot" which describes how the devices act when they are infected. 
- Malicious bot software infects a host, usually through an email or web page link, by downloading and installing a remote control function. 
- When infected, the “zombie” computer contacts servers managed by the botnet creator. 
- These servers act as a command and control (C&C) center for an entire network of compromised devices, which is called a botnet. 
- Infected machines can often pass the software to other unprotected devices in their network, increasing the size of the botnet. 
- Some botnets include many thousands of infected devices.

- Bot software programs can also cause security issues on the infected machines. 
- This is because the installed software may include the ability to log keystrokes, gather passwords, capture and analyze packets, gather financial information, launch DoS attacks, and relay spam. 
- Bots take advantage of time zones, often waking up the zombie systems during the idle times in each time zone. 
- Many users keep their computers always connected to the internet, even when they are away from home or sleeping. 
- This creates the perfect environment for botnet creators to use the bandwidth and processing power of the idle devices.
