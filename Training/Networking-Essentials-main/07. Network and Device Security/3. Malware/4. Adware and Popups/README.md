## Adware

- Adware is a form of spyware that is used to collect information about a user based on websites the user visits. 
- That information is then used for targeted advertising. 
- Adware is commonly installed by a user in exchange for a "free" product. 
- When a user opens a browser window, adware can start new browser instances which attempt to advertise products or services based on the surfing practices of a user. 
- The unwanted browser windows can open repeatedly, and can make surfing the internet very difficult, especially with slow internet connections. 

- Adware can be very difficult to uninstall.

## Popups & Pop-unders

- Popups and pop-unders are additional advertising windows that display when a website is visited. Unlike adware, popups and pop-unders are not intended to collect information about the user and are typically associated only with the website being visited.

- **Popups:** These open in front of the current browser window.

- **Pop-unders:** These open behind the current browser window.

- They can be annoying and usually advertise products or services that are not wanted by the user.
