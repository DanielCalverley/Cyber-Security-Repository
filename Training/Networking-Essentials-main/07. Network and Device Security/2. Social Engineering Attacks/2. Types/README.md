## Types of Social Engineering Attacks

## 1. Pretexting

- Pretexting is a form of social engineering where an invented scenario (the pretext) is used on a victim in order to get the victim to release information or perform an action. The target is typically contacted over the telephone. 
- For pretexting to be effective, the attacker must be able to establish legitimacy with the intended target, or victim. 
- This often requires some prior knowledge or research on the part of the attacker. 
- For example, if a threat actor knows the social security number of the target, the threat actor may use that information to gain the trust of the target. 

- The target is then more likely to release further information.

## 2. Phishing

- Phishing is a form of social engineering where the phisher pretends to represent a legitimate person from another organization. 
- The phisher typically contacts the target individual via email, or text messaging. 

- The phisher might ask for verification of information, such as passwords or usernames in order to prevent some terrible consequence from occurring.

## 3. Vishing or Phone Phishing

- A new form of social engineering that uses Voice over IP (VoIP) is known as vishing. 

- With vishing, unsuspecting users are sent a voice mail instructing them to call a number which appears to be a legitimate telephone-banking service. 
- The call is then intercepted by a thief. 
- Bank account numbers or passwords entered over the phone for verification are then stolen.
