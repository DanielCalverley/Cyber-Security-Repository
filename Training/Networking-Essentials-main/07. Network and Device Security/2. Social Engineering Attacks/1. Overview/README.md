# Overview of Social Engineering

- One of the easiest ways for an intruder to gain access, whether internal or external, is by exploiting human behavior. 
- One of the more common methods of exploiting human weaknesses is called social engineering.

- Social engineering is a term that refers to the ability of something or someone to influence the behavior of a person or group of people. 
- In the context of computer and network security, social engineering refers to a collection of techniques used to deceive internal users into performing specific actions or revealing confidential information.

- With these techniques, the attacker takes advantage of unsuspecting legitimate users to gain access to internal resources and private information, such as bank account numbers or passwords.

- Social engineering attacks exploit the fact that users are generally considered one of the weakest links in security. 
- Social engineers can be internal or external to the organization, but most often do not come face-to-face with their victims.
