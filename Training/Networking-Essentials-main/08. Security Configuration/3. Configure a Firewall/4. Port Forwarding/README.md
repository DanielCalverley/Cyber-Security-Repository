# Port Forwarding

- One of the ways that you can permit other users to reach devices on your network through the internet is a function called port forwarding. 
- Port forwarding is a rule-based method of directing traffic between devices on separate networks. 
 
- This method of exposing your devices to the internet is much safer than using a DMZ.

- When incoming traffic from the internet reaches your router, the firewall in the router determines if the traffic should be forwarded to a certain device based on the port number found with the traffic. 
- Port numbers are associated with specific services, such as FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, and POP3. 
- The rules that you configure in the firewall settings determine which traffic is permitted on to the LAN. 
- For example, a router might be configured to forward port 80, which is associated with HTTP. 
 
- When the router receives a packet with the destination port of 80, the router forwards the traffic to the device inside the network that serves web pages.
