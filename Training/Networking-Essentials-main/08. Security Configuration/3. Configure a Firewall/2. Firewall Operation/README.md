# Firewall Operation

- Firewalls can be implemented in software which is to be loaded onto PCs, networking devices, or servers. 
- Firewalls may also be hardware devices that are installed for the single purpose of protecting areas within the network. 
- A hardware firewall is a freestanding unit that does not use the resources of the computers it is protecting, so there is no impact on processing performance. 
- The firewall can be configured to block multiple individual external devices by IP address, to permit or deny packets matching the range of TCP or UDP ports that you specify, or even traffic that is specific to an application such as a multiplayer video game.

- Typically a hardware firewall passes two different types of traffic into your network:  
      
        Responses to traffic that originates from inside your network
        Traffic that originated from outside the organization that is destined for a port that you have intentionally permitted

- Additionally, firewalls often perform Network Address Translation (NAT). 
- NAT translates an internal private address or group of addresses into registered IP addresses that can be sent across the internet. 
- This allows internal IP addresses to be concealed from outside users.
