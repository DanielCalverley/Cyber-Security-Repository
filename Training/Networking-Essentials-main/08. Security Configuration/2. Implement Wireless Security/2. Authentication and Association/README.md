# Authentication and Association

- After authentication is enabled, regardless of the method used, the client must successfully pass authentication before it can associate with the AP and join your network. 
- If both authentication and MAC address filtering are enabled, authentication occurs first.

- When authentication is successful, the AP will then check the MAC address against the MAC address table. 
- After verification, the AP adds the host MAC address into its host table. 
- The client is then said to be associated with the AP and can connect to the network.
