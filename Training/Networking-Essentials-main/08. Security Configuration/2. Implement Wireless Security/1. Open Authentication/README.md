# Open Authentication

- In addition to MAC address filtering, another way to control who can connect to your network is to implement authentication. 
- `Authentication` is the process of permitting entry to a network based on a set of credentials. 
- It is used to verify that the device that is attempting to connect to the network is trusted.

- The use of a username and password is a most common form of authentication. 
- In a wireless environment, authentication still ensures that the connected host is verified, but handles the verification process in a slightly different manner.  

- Authentication, if enabled, must occur before the client is allowed to connect to the WLAN. 
- There are different types of wireless authentication methods including open authentication, PSK, EAP, and SAE. PSK, EAP, and SAE are beyond the scope of this course.

- By default, wireless devices do not require authentication. 
- Any and all clients are able to associate regardless of what they are, as shown in the figure. 
- This is referred to as `open authentication`. 
- Open authentication should only be used on public wireless networks such as those found in many schools and restaurants. 
- It can also be used on networks where authentication will be done by other means after a device is connected to the network. 
- The setup utility on many routers disables open authentication and automatically sets up more secure user authentication on the wireless LAN.
