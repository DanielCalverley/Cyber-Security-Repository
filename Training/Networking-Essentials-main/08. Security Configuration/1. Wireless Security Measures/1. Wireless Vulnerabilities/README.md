# Wireless Vulnerabilities

- One of the primary benefits of wireless networking is ease and convenience of connecting devices. 
- Unfortunately, that ease of connectivity and the fact that the information is transmitted through the air also makes your network vulnerable to interception and attacks, as shown in the figure. 

- Before your wireless network is installed, it is important to consider how you plan to secure access to it.

- **War-driving** is the process of driving around an area searching for wireless LANs. 
- When a wireless LAN is discovered, the location of the WLAN is logged and shared. 
- The goal of war-driving may be to access the WLAN to steal information. 
- In some cases, the goal is to bring attention to the fact that most wireless networks are insecure.

- A similar process to war-driving is known as **war-walking** where the person walks around an area to discover wireless access. 
- When a WLAN is discovered, a chalk mark is placed in front of the location to indicate the status of the wireless connection.

- With wireless connectivity, the attacker does not need a physical connection to your computer or any of your devices to access your network. 
- It is possible for an attacker to tune into signals from your wireless network, much like tuning into a radio station.

- The attacker can access your network from any location your wireless signal reaches. 
- After they have access to your network, they can use your Internet services for free, as well as access computers on the network to damage files, or steal personal and private information.

- These vulnerabilities in wireless networking require special security features and implementation methods to help protect your WLAN from attacks. 
- These include simple steps performed during initial setup of the wireless device, as well as more advanced security configurations.
