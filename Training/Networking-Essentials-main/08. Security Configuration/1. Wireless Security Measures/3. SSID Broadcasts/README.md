# SSID Broadcast

- One easy way to gain entry to a wireless network is through the network name, or SSID.

- All computers connecting to the wireless network must be configured with or connect to the appropriate SSID. 
- By default, wireless routers and access points broadcast SSIDs to all computers within the wireless range. 
- With SSID broadcast activated, any wireless client can detect the network and connect to it, if no other security features are in place.

- The SSID broadcast feature can be turned off. 
- When it is turned off, the fact that the network is there is no longer made public. 
- Any computer trying to connect to the network must already know the SSID. 
- Turning off SSID broadcast alone does not protect the wireless network from experienced threat actors. 
- The SSID can be determined by capturing and analyzing the wireless packets that are exchanged between the clients and the access point. 
- Even with SSID broadcasting disabled, it is possible for someone to get into your network using the well-known default SSID. 
- Additionally, if other default settings, such as passwords and IP addresses are not changed, attackers can access an AP and make changes themselves. 
- Default information should be changed to something more secure and unique.
