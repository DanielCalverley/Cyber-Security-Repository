# Changing Default Settings

- What are default settings and why are they there? 
- Most wireless access points and routers are preconfigured with settings such as SSIDs, administrator passwords, and IP addresses. 
- These settings make it easier for the novice user to set up and configure the device in the home LAN environment. 
- Unfortunately, these defaults can also make it easy for an attacker to identify and infiltrate a network.

- Changing the default settings on a wireless router will not protect your network by itself. 
- For example, SSIDs are transmitted in plaintext. 
- There are devices that will intercept wireless signals and read plaintext messages. 
- Even with SSID broadcast turned off and default values changed, attackers can learn the name of a wireless network through the use of these devices that intercept wireless signals. 
- This information will be used to connect to the network. 
- It takes a combination of several methods to protect your WLAN.
