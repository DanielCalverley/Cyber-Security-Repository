# MAC Address Filtering

- One way to limit access to the wireless network is to control exactly which devices are allowed on the wireless network (or on some routers/APs the configuration is what devices are not allowed) by filtering MAC addresses. 
- If MAC address filtering is configured for devices that are allowed on the network, when a wireless client attempts to connect, or associate, with an AP it will send MAC address information. 
- The wireless router or AP will look up the MAC address of the connecting client and permit or allow the device onto the wireless network based on the configuration.

- There are some issues with this type of security. 
- The person setting up the wireless router/AP will have to enter MAC addresses, so this measure does not scale well. 
- Additionally, it is possible for an attacking device to clone the MAC address of another device that has access.
