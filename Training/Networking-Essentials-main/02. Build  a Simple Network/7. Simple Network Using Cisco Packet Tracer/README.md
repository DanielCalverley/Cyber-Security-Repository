- Every device that sends messages across the internet must have an Internet Protocol (IP) address to identify it to the other devices in the network.
-  IP addresses are assigned by network administrators.
-  When a new device is added to a network, or if an existing device is having problems, it may be necessary to test the network to determine if the IP address assigned to the device can be reached by other devices on the network.
