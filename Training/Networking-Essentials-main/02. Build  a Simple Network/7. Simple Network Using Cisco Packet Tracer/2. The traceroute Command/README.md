# The traceroute

- The internet is not really a place; it is the interconnection of many different networks that provide services to the users. We can see this connectivity by using a network utility call `traceroute`.
- the traceroute utility traces the route a message takes from its source to the destination.
- Each individual network through which the message travels is referred to as a hop.
- The traceroute command displays each hop along the way and the time it takes for the message to get to that network and back.
- If a problem occurs, use the output of the traceroute utility to help determine where a message was lost or delayed.
- The traceroute utility is called `tracert` in the Windows environment.
