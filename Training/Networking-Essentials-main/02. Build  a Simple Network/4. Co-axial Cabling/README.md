# Cable TV and Satellite Cables

- Like twisted-pair, coaxial cable (or coax) carries data in the form of electrical signals. It provides improved shielding compared to UTP and can therefore carry more data.
- Coaxial cable is usually constructed of either copper or aluminum.
- It is used by cable television companies to provide service and for connecting the various components that make up satellite communication systems. 
- You are probably familiar with the coaxial cables used to connect a TV set to the signal source, be it a cable TV outlet, satellite TV, or conventional antenna in your home. 
- With the addition of a cable modem, the cable television provider can offer data and internet service, as well as television signals and telephone over the same coaxial cable.
- Although coax has improved data carrying characteristics, twisted-pair cabling has replaced coax in local area networking uses.
- Among the reasons for the replacement is that compared to UTP, coax is physically harder to install, more expensive, and harder to troubleshoot.
