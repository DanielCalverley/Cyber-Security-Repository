# Twisted-Pair Cable

- Ethernet technology generally uses twisted-pair cables to interconnect devices.
- Because Ethernet is the foundation for most local networks, twisted-pair is the most commonly encountered type of network cabling.
- In twisted-pair, wires are grouped in pairs and twisted together to reduce interference.
- The pairs of wires are colored so that you can identify the same wire at each end.
-  Typically, in each pair, one of the wires is a solid color and its partner is the same color striped onto a white background.

# Co-axial Cable

- Coaxial was one of the earliest types of network cabling developed.
- Coaxial cable is the kind of copper cable used by cable TV companies. 
- It is also used for connecting the various components which make up satellite communication systems.
- Coaxial cable has a single rigid copper core that conducts the signal.
- This core is typically surrounded by a layer of insulation, braided metal shielding, and a protective jacket.
- It is used as a high-frequency transmission line to carry high-frequency or broadband signals.

# Fiber-Optic Cable

- Fiber-optic cable can be either glass or plastic with a diameter about the same as a human hair and it can carry digital information at very high speeds over long distances.
- Because light is used instead of electricity, electrical interference does not affect the signal.
- They have a very high bandwidth, which enables them to carry very large amounts of data.
-  Fiber is used in backbone networks, large enterprise environments, and large data centers. 
-  It is also used extensively by telephone companies.
