# Static IPv4 Address Assignment

- IPv4 addresses can be assigned either statically or dynamically.
- With a static assignment, the network administrator must manually configure the network information for a host.
- At a minimum, this includes the host IPv4 address, subnet mask, and default gateway, as shown in the figure.
- Static addresses have some advantages.
- For instance, they are useful for printers, servers, and other networking devices that need to be accessible to clients on the network.
- If hosts normally access a server at a particular IPv4 address, it would not be good if that address changed.
- Static assignment of addressing information can provide increased control of network resources, but it can be time consuming to enter the information on each host.
- When IPv4 addresses are entered statically, the host only performs basic error checks on the IPv4 address.
- Therefore, errors are more likely to occur.
- When using static IPv4 addressing, it is important to maintain an accurate list of which IPv4 addresses are assigned to which devices.
- Additionally, these are permanent addresses and are not normally reused.
