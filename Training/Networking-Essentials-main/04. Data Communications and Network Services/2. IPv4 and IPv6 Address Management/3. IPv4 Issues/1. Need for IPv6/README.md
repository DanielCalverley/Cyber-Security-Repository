# Need for IPv6

- IPv6 is designed to be the successor to IPv4.
- IPv6 has a larger 128-bit address space, providing 340 undecillion (i.e., 340 followed by 36 zeroes) possible addresses.
- However, IPv6 is more than just larger address space.
- When the IETF began its development of a successor to IPv4, it used this opportunity to fix the limitations of IPv4 and include enhancements.
- One example is Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6), which includes address resolution and address autoconfiguration not found in ICMP for IPv4 (ICMPv4) IPv6 addresses.
- The depletion of IPv4 address space has been the motivating factor for moving to IPv6.
- As Africa, Asia and other areas of the world become more connected to the internet, there are not enough IPv4 addresses to accommodate this growth.
- As shown in the figure, four out of the five RIRs have run out of IPv4 addresses. 
- AfriNIC will run out of IPv4 addresses very soon.

- IPv4 has a theoretical maximum of 4.3 billion addresses.
- Private addresses in combination with Network Address Translation (NAT) have been instrumental in slowing the depletion of IPv4 address space.
- However, NAT is problematic for many applications, creates latency, and has limitations that severely impede peer-to-peer communications.
- With the ever-increasing number of mobile devices, mobile providers have been leading the way with the transition to IPv6.
- The top two mobile providers in the United States report that over 90% of their traffic is over IPv6.
- Most top ISPs and content providers such as YouTube, Facebook, and Netflix, have also made the transition.
- Many companies like Microsoft, Facebook, and LinkedIn are transitioning to IPv6-only internally.
- In 2018, broadband ISP Comcast reported a deployment of over 65% and British Sky Broadcasting over 86%.
