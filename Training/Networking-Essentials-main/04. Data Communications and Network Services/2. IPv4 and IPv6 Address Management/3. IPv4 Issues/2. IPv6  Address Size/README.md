# IPv6 Address Size

- IPv6 addressing will eventually replace IPv4 addressing, although both types of addresses will coexist for the foreseeable future.
- IPv6 overcomes the limitations of IPv4 and has features that better suit current and foreseeable network demands.
- The 32-bit IPv4 address space provides approximately 4,294,967,296 unique addresses.
- IPv6 address space provides 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses, or 340 undecillion addresses, which is roughly equivalent to the number of grains of sand on Earth.
- The figure provides a visual to compare the IPv4 and IPv6 address space.
- Other benefits of the IPv6 protocol include these:

    - No need for NAT. Each device can have its own globally routable address.
    - Autoconfiguration capabilities simplify address administration.

- The designers of IPv6 thought that it would be adopted quickly, as the number of remaining available IPv4 address blocks was decreasing rapidly.
- Initial estimates were that IPv6 would be globally deployed by 2003.
- Obviously, these estimates were incorrect.
