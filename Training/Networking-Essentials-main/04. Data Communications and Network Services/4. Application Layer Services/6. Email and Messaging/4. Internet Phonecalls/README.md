# Internet Phonecalls

- Making telephone calls over the internet is becoming increasingly popular. 
- An internet telephony client uses peer-to-peer technology similar to that used by instant messaging, as shown in the figure. 
- IP telephony makes use of Voice over IP (VoIP) technology, which converts analog voice signals into digital data. 
- The voice data is encapsulated into IP packets which carry the phone call through the network.

- When the IP phone software has been installed, the user selects a unique name. 
- This is so that calls can be received from other users. 
- Speakers and a microphone, built-in or separate, are required. 
- A headset is frequently plugged into the computer to serve as a phone.

- Calls are made to other users of the same service on the internet, by selecting the username from a list. 
- A call to a regular telephone (landline or cell phone) requires using a gateway to access the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). 
- Depending on the service, there may be charges associated with this type of call. 
- The protocols and destination ports used by internet telephony applications can vary based on the software.
