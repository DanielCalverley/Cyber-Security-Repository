# Email Clients and Servers

- Email is one of the most popular client/server applications on the internet. 
- Email servers run server software that enables them to interact with clients and with other email servers over the network.

- Each mail server receives and stores mail for users who have mailboxes configured on the mail server. 
- Each user with a mailbox must then use an email client to access the mail server and read these messages. 
- Many internet messaging systems use a web-based client to access email. 
- Examples of this type of client include Microsoft 365, Yahoo, and Gmail.

- Mailboxes are identified by the format: user@câ€‹ompany.domain

- Various application protocols used in processing email include SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4.
