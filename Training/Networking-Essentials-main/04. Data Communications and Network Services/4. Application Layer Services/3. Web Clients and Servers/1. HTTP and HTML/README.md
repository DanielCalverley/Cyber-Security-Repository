# HTTP and HTML

- When a web client receives the IP address of a web server, the client browser uses that IP address and port 80 to request web services. 
- This request is sent to the server using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

- When the server receives a port 80 request, the server responds to the client request and sends the web page to the client. 
- The information content of a web page is encoded using specialized 'mark-up' languages. 
- The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) coding tells the browser how to format the web page and what graphics and fonts to use. 
- HTML is the most commonly used language.

- The HTTP protocol is not a secure protocol; information could easily be intercepted by other users as data is sent over the network. 
- In order to provide security for the data, HTTP can be used with secure transport protocols. 
- Requests for secure HTTP are sent to port 443. 
- These requests use https in the site address in the browser, rather than HTTP.
