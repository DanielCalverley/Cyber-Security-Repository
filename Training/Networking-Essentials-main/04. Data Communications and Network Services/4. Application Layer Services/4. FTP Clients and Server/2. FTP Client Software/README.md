# FTP Client Software

- Most client operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS, and Linux include a command-line interface for FTP. 
- There is also GUI-based FTP client software that provides a simple drag-and-drop interface for FTP. 

- After logging into the FTP server with a username and password, the user drags files between the local host window and the remote site (FTP server) window to transfer files.
