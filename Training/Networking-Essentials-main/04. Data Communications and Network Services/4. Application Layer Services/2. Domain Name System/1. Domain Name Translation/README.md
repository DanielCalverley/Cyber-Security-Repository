# Domain Name Translation

- Thousands of servers, installed in many different locations, provide the services that we use daily over the internet. 
- Each of these servers is assigned a unique IP address that identifies it on the local network where it is connected.
- It would be impossible to remember all of the IP addresses for all of the servers hosting services on the internet. 
- Instead, there is an easier way to locate servers by associating a name with an IP address.
- The Domain Name System (DNS) provides a way for hosts to use this name to request the IP address of a specific server, as shown in the figure. 
- DNS names are registered and organized on the internet within specific high level groups, or domains. 
- Some of the most common high level domains on the internet are .com, .edu, and .net.
