# Client Requests a Web Page

- Much of the information that we receive over the internet is provided in the form of web page documents.
- To request and view a web page, a person uses a device that is running web client software, such as a web browser.
- The key characteristic of client/server systems is that the client sends a request to a server, and the server responds by carrying out a function, such as sending the requested document back to the client.
- The combination of a web browser and a web server is perhaps the most commonly used instance of a client/server system.
- A web server is usually in a part of the network with other servers called a server farm, or within a data center.
- A data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated components.
- A data center can occupy one room of a building, one or more floors, or an entire building.
- Data centers are typically very expensive to build and maintain.
- For this reason, only large organizations use privately built data centers to house their data and provide services to users.
- Smaller organizations that cannot afford to maintain their own private data center can reduce the overall cost of ownership by leasing server and storage services from a larger data center organization in the cloud.
