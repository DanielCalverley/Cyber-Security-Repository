# URI, URL and URN

## 1. URI

- Web resources and web services such as RESTful APIs are identified using a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). 
- A URI is a string of characters that identifies a specific network resource. As shown in the figure, a URI has two specializations: 

## 2. URN:

- Uniform Resource Name.
- This identifies only the namespace of the resource (web page, document, image, etc.) without reference to the protocol.

## 3. URL:

- This defines the network location of a specific resource on the network. 
- HTTP or HTTPS URLs are typically used with web browsers. 
- Other protocols such as FTP, SFTP, SSH, and others can use a URL. 
- A URL using SFTP might look like: sftp://sftp.example.com.

## These are the parts of a URI, as shown in the figure:

    Protocol/scheme - HTTPS or other protocols such as FTP, SFTP, mailto, and NNTP
    Hostname - www.example.com
    Path and file name - /author/book.html
    Fragment - #page155
