# Client - Server Interaction

- The term server refers to a host running a software application that provides information or services to other hosts that are connected to the network.
- A well-known example of an application is a web server.
- There are millions of servers connected to the internet, providing services such as web sites, email, financial transactions, music downloads, etc.
- A crucial factor to enable these complex interactions to function is that they all use agreed upon standards and protocols.
- An example of client software is a web browser, like Chrome or Firefox.
- A single computer can also run multiple types of client software.
- For example, a user can check email and view a web page while instant messaging and listening to an audio stream.
