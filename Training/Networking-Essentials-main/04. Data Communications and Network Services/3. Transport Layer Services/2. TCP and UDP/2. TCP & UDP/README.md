# TCP & UDP

- Each service available over the network has its own application protocols that are implemented in the server and client software.
-  In addition to the application protocols, all of the common internet services use Internet Protocol (IP) to address and route messages between source and destination hosts, as shown in the figure.
- IP is concerned only with the structure, addressing, and routing of packets. 
- IP does not specify how the delivery or transportation of the packets takes place. 
- The application decides which transport protocol to use. 
- Transport protocols specify how to manage the transfer of messages between hosts. 
- The two most common transport protocols are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). 
- The IP protocol uses these transport protocols to enable hosts to communicate and transfer data.
