# The netstat Command

- Unexplained TCP connections can pose a major security threat. 
- They can indicate that something or someone is connected to the local host. 
- Sometimes it is necessary to know which active TCP connections are open and running on a networked host. 
- Netstat is an important network utility that can be used to verify those connections. 
- As shown below, enter the command netstat to list the protocols in use, the local address and port numbers, the foreign address and port numbers, and the connection state.

- By default, the netstat command will attempt to resolve IP addresses to domain names and port numbers to well-known applications. 
- The -n option can be used to display IP addresses and port numbers in their numerical form.
