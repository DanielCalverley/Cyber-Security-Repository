# Additional Connectivity Options

- Other ISP connection options for home users include the following:

**1. Cellular:** 

- Cellular internet access uses a cell phone network to connect. 
- Wherever you can get a cellular signal, you can get cellular internet access. 
- Performance will be limited by the capabilities of the phone and the cell tower to which it is connected.
- The availability of cellular internet access is a real benefit for people in areas that would otherwise have no internet connectivity at all, or for people who are constantly on the move. 
- The downside of cellular connectivity is that the carrier usually meters the bandwidth usage of the connection and may charge extra for bandwidth that exceeds the contract data plan.
    
**2. Satellite:**

- Satellite service is a good option for homes or offices that do not have access to DSL or cable. 
- Satellite dishes (see figure) require a clear line of sight to the satellite and so might be difficult in heavily wooded areas or places with other overhead obstructions.  
- Speeds will vary depending on the contract, though they are generally good. 
- Equipment and installation costs can be high (although check the provider for special deals), with a moderate monthly fee thereafter. 
- Like cellular access, the availability of satellite internet access is a real benefit in areas that would otherwise have no internet connectivity at all.
    
**3. Dial-up Telephone:**

- An inexpensive option that uses any phone line and a modem. 
- To connect to the ISP, a user calls the ISP access phone number. 
- The low bandwidth provided by a dial-up modem connection is usually not sufficient for large data transfer, although it is useful for mobile access while traveling. 
- A modem dial-up connection should only be considered when higher speed connection options are not available.

- In metropolitan areas, many apartments and small offices are being connected directly with fiber-optic cables. 
- This enables an internet service provider to provide higher bandwidth speeds and support more services such as internet, phone, and TV.

- The choice of connection varies depending on geographical location and service provider availability.
