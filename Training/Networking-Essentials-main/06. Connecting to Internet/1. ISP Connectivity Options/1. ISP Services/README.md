# ISP Services

- An Internet Service Provider (ISP) provides the link between the home network and the internet. 
- An ISP can be the local cable provider, a landline telephone service provider, the cellular network that provides your smart phone service, or an independent provider who leases bandwidth on the physical network infrastructure of another company.

- Many ISPs also offer additional services to their contract subscribers, as shown in the figure. 
- These services can include email accounts, network storage, and website hosting and automated backup or security services.

- ISPs are critical to communications across the global internet. 
- Each ISP connects to other ISPs to form a network of links that interconnect users all over the world. 
- ISPs are connected in a hierarchical manner that ensures that internet traffic generally takes the shortest path from the source to the destination.

- The internet backbone is like an information super highway that provides high-speed data links to connect the various service provider networks in major metropolitan areas around the world. 
- The primary medium that connects the internet backbone is fiber-optic cable. 
- This cable is typically installed underground to connect cities within continents. 
- Fiber-optic cables also run under the sea to connect continents, countries, and cities.

- The figure shows seven small circles surrounding a big circle in the center. 
- The big circle is labeled ISP Services. 
- The seven small circles are labeled FTP Hosting, Application and Media Hosting, Web Hosting, Equipment Co-Location, POP Internet Access, Voice Over IP, and Technical Support.
