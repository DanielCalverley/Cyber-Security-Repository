# ISP Connections

- The interconnection of ISPs that forms the backbone of the internet is a complex web of fiber-optic cables with expensive networking switches and routers that direct the flow of information between source and destination hosts. 
- Average home users are not aware of the infrastructure outside of their network. 
- For a home user, connecting to the ISP is a fairly uncomplicated process.

- The top portion of the figure displays the simplest ISP connection option. 
- It consists of a modem that provides a direct connection between a computer and the ISP. 
- This option should not be used though, because your computer is not protected on the internet.

- As shown in the bottom portion of the figure, a router is required to securely connect a computer to an ISP. 
- This is the most common connection option. 
- It consists of using a wireless integrated router to connect to the ISP. 
- The router includes a switch to connect wired hosts and a wireless AP to connect wireless hosts. 
- The router also provides client IP addressing information and security for inside hosts.
