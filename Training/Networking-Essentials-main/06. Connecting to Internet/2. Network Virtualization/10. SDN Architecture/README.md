# SDN Architecture 

- In a traditional router or switch architecture, the control plane and data plane functions occur in the same device. 
 
- Routing decisions and packet forwarding are the responsibility of the device operating system. 
- In SDN, management of the control plane is moved to a centralized SDN controller. 

- The figure compares traditional and SDN architectures.

- The SDN controller is a logical entity that enables network administrators to manage and dictate how the data plane of switches and routers should handle network traffic. 

- It typically runs on a server. 
- It orchestrates, mediates, and facilitates communication between applications and network elements.
