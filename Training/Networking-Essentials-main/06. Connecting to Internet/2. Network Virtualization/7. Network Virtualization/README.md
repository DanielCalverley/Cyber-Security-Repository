# Network Virtualization

- Virtualization separates the operating system (OS) from the hardware.

- Server virtualization takes advantage of idle resources and consolidates the number of required servers. 
- This also allows for multiple operating systems to exist on a single hardware platform.

- For example, in the figure, the previous eight dedicated servers have been consolidated into two servers using hypervisors to support multiple virtual instances of the operating systems.

- Network virtualization combines traditional networking hardware and software network resources into a software-based entity, which is a virtual network. 
- Could the network infrastructure also benefit from virtualization? 
- If so, then how? 
- The answer is found in how a networking device operates using a data plane and a control plane.
