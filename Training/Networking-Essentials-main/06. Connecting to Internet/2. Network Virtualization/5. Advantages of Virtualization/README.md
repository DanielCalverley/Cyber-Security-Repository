# Advantages of Virtualization

### Major Advantages

   - Overall reduced cost
   - Less equipment is required - Virtualization enables server consolidation, which requires fewer physical devices, lowers maintenance costs.
   - Less energy is consumed - Consolidating servers lowers the monthly power and cooling costs.
   - Less space is required - Server consolidation reduces the amount of required floor space.

### Additional Benefits

   - Easier prototyping - Self-contained labs, operating on isolated networks, can be rapidly created for testing and prototyping network deployments.
   - Faster server provisioning - Creating a virtual server is far faster than provisioning a physical server.
   - Increased server uptime - Most server virtualization platforms now offer advanced redundant fault tolerance features.
   - Improved disaster recovery - Most enterprise server virtualization platforms have software that can help test and automate failover before a disaster happens.
   - Legacy support - Virtualization can extend the life of OSs and applications providing more time for organizations to migrate to newer solutions.
