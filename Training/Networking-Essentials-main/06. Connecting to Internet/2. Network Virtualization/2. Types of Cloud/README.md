# Types of Cloud

- There are four primary cloud models,

    **1. Public clouds -**    Cloud-based applications and services offered in a public cloud are made available to the general population. 
                          Services may be free or are offered on a pay-per-use model, such as paying for online storage. 
                          The public cloud uses the internet to provide services.
                          
    **2. Private clouds -**   Cloud-based applications and services offered in a private cloud are intended for a specific organization or entity, such as the government. 
                          A private cloud can be set up using the private network of an organization, though this can be expensive to build and maintain. 
                          A private cloud can also be managed by an outside organization with strict access security.
                          
    **3. Hybrid clouds -**    A hybrid cloud is made up of two or more clouds (example: part private, part public), where each part remains a separate object, but both are 
                          connected 
                          using a single architecture. 
                          Individuals on a hybrid cloud would be able to have degrees of access to various services based on user access rights.
                          
    **4. Community clouds -** A community cloud is created for exclusive use by a specific community. 
                          The differences between public clouds and community clouds are the functional needs that have been customized for the community. 
                          For example, healthcare organizations must remain compliant with policies and laws (e.g., HIPAA) that require special authentication and 
                          confidentiality.
