# Cloud Services


- Cloud services are available in a variety of options, tailored to meet customer requirements. The three main cloud computing services defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in their Special Publication 800-145 are as follows:

    **1. Software as a Service (SaaS) -** The cloud provider is responsible for access to applications and services, such as email, communication, and Microsoft 365, that are delivered over the internet. 
                                          The user does not manage any aspect of the cloud services except for limited user-specific application settings. 
                                          The user only needs to provide data.
    
    **2. Platform as a Service (PaaS) -** The cloud provider is responsible for providing users access to the development tools and services used to deliver the applications. 
                                          These users are typically programmers and may have control over the configuration settings of the application hosting environment of the cloud provider.
    
    **3. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) -** The cloud provider is responsible for giving IT managers access to the network equipment, virtualized network services, and supporting network infrastructure. 
                                                Using this cloud service allows IT managers to deploy and run software code, which can include operating systems and applications.

- For businesses, ITaaS can extend the capability of the network without requiring investment in new infrastructure, training new personnel, or licensing new software. 

- These services are available on demand and delivered economically to any device anywhere in the world without compromising security or function.
