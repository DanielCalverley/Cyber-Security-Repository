# Network Virtualization and SDN 

- Network virtualization combines networking hardware and software network resources into a software-based entity which is a virtual network.

- Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a network architecture that virtualizes the network, offering a new approach to network administration and management that seeks to simplify and streamline the administration process

- SDN is basically the separation of the control plane and data plane. 
- The control plane function is removed from each device and is performed by a centralized controller, as shown in the figure. 

- The centralized controller communicates control plane functions to each device. 
- Each device can now focus on forwarding data while the centralized controller manages data flow, increases security, and provides other services.
