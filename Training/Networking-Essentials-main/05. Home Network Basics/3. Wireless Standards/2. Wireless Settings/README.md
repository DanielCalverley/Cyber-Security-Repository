# Wireless Settings

The Packet Tracer Basic Wireless Settings interface is shown in the figure. Wireless routers using the `802.11 standards` have multiple settings that have to be configured.\
These settings include the following:

    1. Network mode - Determines the type of technology that must be supported. 
                      For example, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n or Mixed Mode.
    2. Network Name (SSID) - Used to identify the WLAN. All devices that wish to participate in the WLAN must have the same SSID.
    3. Standard Channel - Specifies the channel over which communication will occur. 
                          By default, this is set to Auto to allow the AP to determine the optimum channel to use.
    4. SSID Broadcast - Determines if the SSID will be broadcast to all devices within range. By default, set to Enabled.

- Note: SSID stands for Service Set Identifier.
