# Wi-Fi Networks

- A number of standards have been developed to ensure that wireless devices can communicate. 
- They specify the RF spectrum used, data rates, how the information is transmitted, and more. 
- The main organization responsible for the creation of wireless technical standards is the IEEE.

- The IEEE 802.11 standard governs the WLAN environment. 
- There are amendments to the IEEE 802.11 standard that describe characteristics for different standards of wireless communications. 
- Wireless standards for LANs use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. 
- Collectively these technologies are referred to as Wi-Fi.

- Another organization, known as the Wi-Fi Alliance, is responsible for testing wireless LAN devices from different manufacturers. 
- The Wi-Fi logo on a device means that this equipment meets standards and should operate with other devices that use the same standard.

- Wireless standards are constantly improving the connectivity and speed of Wi-Fi networks. 
- It is important to be aware of new standards as they are introduced because manufacturers of wireless devices will implement these standards quickly in their new products.
