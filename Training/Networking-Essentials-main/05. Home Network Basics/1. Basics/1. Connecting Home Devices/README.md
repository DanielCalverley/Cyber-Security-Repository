# Connecting Home Devices

- Not long ago, home networks consisted of a desktop PC, a modem for internet, and perhaps a printer. 

- In the homes of today, there are dozens of devices that rely on network connectivity. 

- We can watch our security cameras from apps on our smart phones, make a telephone call from our PCs, and stream live video content from anywhere in the world.

- A home network is a small LAN with devices that usually connect to an integrated router and to each other in order to exchange information. 

- The router is connected to the internet, as shown in the figure below.

- Most likely, the home router is equipped with both wired and wireless capabilities. 
- Wireless technology offers many advantages compared to traditional wired networks.
- One of the main advantages of wireless is the ability to provide anytime, anywhere connectivity. 

- Within a home LAN, items such as smart phones and tablets are mobile. 
- Televisions and other audio/video devices may be mounted in more permanent locations and may benefit from wired connectivity.

- Wireless technology is fairly easy and inexpensive to install. 
- The cost of home and business wireless devices continues to decrease. 
- Yet, despite the decrease in cost, the data rate and capabilities of these devices have increased, allowing faster, more reliable wireless connections.

- Wireless technology enables networks to be easily expanded, without the limitations of cabled connections. 
- New and visiting users can join the network quickly and easily.
