# Wireless Channels

- Wireless devices that transmit over the same frequency range create interference in a Wi-Fi network. 
- Home electronic devices, such as cordless phones, other wireless networks, and baby monitors, may use this same frequency range. 
- These devices can slow down the Wi-Fi performance and potentially break network connections.

- Channels are created by dividing up the available RF spectrum. 
- Each channel is capable of carrying a different conversation, as shown in the figure. 
- This is similar to the way that multiple television channels are transmitted across a single medium. 
- Multiple APs can function in close proximity to one another as long as they use different channels for communication. 
- Normally each wireless conversation makes use of a separate channel. 
- Some of the 5 GHz wireless technologies combine multiple channels to create a single wide channel, which provides more bandwidth and increases the data rate.
