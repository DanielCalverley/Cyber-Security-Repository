# Wired Network Technologies

- Although many home network devices support wireless communications, there are still a few applications where devices benefit from a wired switch connection that is not shared with other users on the network.

- The most commonly implemented wired protocol is the Ethernet protocol. 
- Ethernet uses a suite of protocols that allow network devices to communicate over a wired LAN connection. 
- An Ethernet LAN can connect devices using many different types of wiring media.

- Directly connected devices use an Ethernet patch cable, usually unshielded twisted-pair. 
- These cables can be purchased with the RJ-45 connectors already installed, and they come in various lengths. 
- Recently constructed homes may have Ethernet jacks already wired in the walls of the home. 
- For those homes that do not have UTP wiring, there are other technologies, such as powerline, that can distribute wired connectivity throughout the premises.

### Category 5e Cable

- Category 5e is the most common wiring used in a LAN. The cable is made up of 4 pairs of wires that are twisted to reduce electrical interference.

### Coaxial Cable

- Coaxial cable has an inner wire surrounded by a tubular insulating layer, that is then surrounded by a tubular conducting shield. 
- Most coax cables also have an external insulating sheath or jacket.

### Ethernet over Powerline

- Existing power lines in a house can be used to connect devices to an Ethernet LAN.
