# LAN Wireless Frequencies

- The wireless technologies most frequently used in home networks are in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency ranges.

- Bluetooth is a technology that makes use of the 2.4 GHz band. 
- It is limited to low-speed, short-range communications, but has the advantage of communicating with many devices at the same time. 
- This one-to-many communication has made Bluetooth technology the preferred method for connecting computer peripherals such as wireless mice, keyboards and printers.
- Bluetooth is a good method for transmitting audio to speakers or headphones.

- Other technologies that use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands are the modern wireless LAN technologies that conform to the various IEEE 802.11 standards. 
- Unlike Bluetooth technology, 802.11 devices transmit at a much higher power level giving them a great range and improved throughput.

- The figure shows where wireless technologies exist on the electromagnetic spectrum.
