# Electromagnetic Spectrum

- What would we do without wireless? 
- Because of the ever-increasing number of things that have the capability of connecting to the internet using wireless technologies, most home networks include some type of wireless network functionality.

- Wireless technologies use electromagnetic waves to carry information between devices. 
- The electromagnetic spectrum includes such things as radio and television broadcast bands, visible light, x-rays and gamma-rays. 
- Each of these has a specific range of wavelengths and associated energies, as shown in the figure.

- Some types of electromagnetic waves are not suitable for carrying data. 
- Other parts of the spectrum are regulated by governments and licensed to various organizations for specific applications. 
- Certain areas of the spectrum have been set aside to allow public use without the restriction of having to apply for special permits. 
- These unlicensed sections of the spectrum are incorporated into consumer products, including the Wi-Fi routers found in most homes.
