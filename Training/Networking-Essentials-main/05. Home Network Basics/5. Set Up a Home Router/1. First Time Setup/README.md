# First Time Setup

- Many wireless routers designed for home use have an automatic setup utility that can be used to configure the basic settings on the router. 
- These utilities usually require a PC or laptop to be connected to a wired port on the router. 
- If no device is available that has a wired connection, it may be necessary to configure the wireless client software on the laptop or tablet first.

- To connect to the router using a wired connection, plug an Ethernet patch cable into the network port on the computer. 
- Plug the other end into a LAN port on the router. 
- Do not plug the cable into the port or interface that is labeled “Internet”. 
- The Internet port will connect to the DSL or cable modem. 
- Some home routers may have a built-in modem for internet connections. 
- If this is the case, verify that the type of connection is correct for your internet service. 
- A cable modem connection will have a coaxial terminal to accept a BNC-type connector. 
- A DSL connection will have a port for a telephone-type cable, usually an RJ-11 connector.

- After confirming that the computer is connected to the network router and the link lights on the NIC indicate a working connection, the computer needs an IP address. 
- Most network routers are set up so that the computer receives an IP address automatically from a local DHCP server automatically configured on the wireless router. 
- If the computer does not have an IP address, check the router documentation and configure the PC or tablet with a unique IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS information.
