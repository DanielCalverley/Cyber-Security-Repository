# Unicast Transmission

- Unicast communication is used for normal host-to-host communication in both a client/server and a peer-to-peer network.
- Unicast packets use the address of the destination device as the destination address and can be routed through an internetwork.
- In an IPv4 network, the unicast address applied to an end device is referred to as the host address.
- For unicast communication, the addresses assigned to the two end devices are used as the source and destination IPv4 addresses.
- During the encapsulation process, the source host uses its IPv4 address as the source address and the IPv4 address of the destination host as the destination address.
- Regardless of whether the destination specified a packet as a unicast, broadcast or multicast; the source address of any packet is always the unicast address of the originating host.
- IPv4 unicast host addresses are in the address range of 0.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255.
- However, within this range are many addresses that are reserved for special purposes.
