# IPv4 Address Assignment

- For a company or organization to support network hosts, such as web servers that are accessible from the internet, that organization must have a block of public addresses assigned.
- Remember that public addresses must be unique, and use of these public addresses is regulated and allocated to each organization separately. This is true for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) (http://www.iana.org).
- The IANA manages and allocates blocks of IP addresses to the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).
- RIRs are responsible for allocating IP addresses to ISPs who in turn provide IPv4 address blocks to organizations and smaller ISPs.
- Organizations can get their addresses directly from an RIR subject to the policies of that RIR.
