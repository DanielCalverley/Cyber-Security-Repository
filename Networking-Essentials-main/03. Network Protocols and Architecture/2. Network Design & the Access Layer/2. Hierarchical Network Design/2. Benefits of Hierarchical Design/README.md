# Benefits of Hierarchical Design

 - In networking, hierarchical design is used to group devices into multiple networks that are organized in a layered approach.
 - This method of designing networks consists of smaller, more manageable groups that allow local traffic to remain local.
 - Only traffic that is destined for other networks is moved to a higher layer.
 - A hierarchical, layered design provides increased efficiency, optimization of function, and increased speed.
 - It allows the network to scale as required because additional local networks can be added without impacting the performance of the existing ones.
 - As shown in the figure, the hierarchical design has three basic layers: 
 
    - **Access Layer:** This layer provides connections to hosts in a local Ethernet network.
    - **Distribution Layer:** This layer interconnects the small local networks.
    - **Core Layer:** This layer provides a high-speed connection between distribution layer devices.

- With a hierarchical design, there is a need for a logical addressing scheme that can identify the location of a host.
- The most common addressing scheme on the internet is Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4).
-  Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the network layer protocol currently being implemented as a replacement for IPv4. IPv4 and IPv6 will coexist for the foreseeable future.
