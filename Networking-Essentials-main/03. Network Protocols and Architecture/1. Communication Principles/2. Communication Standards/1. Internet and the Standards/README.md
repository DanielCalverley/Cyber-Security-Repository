# The Internet & Standards

- A standard is a set of rules that determines how something must be done. 
- Networking and internet standards ensure that all devices connecting to the network implement the same set of rules or protocols in the same manner. 
- Using standards, it is possible for different types of devices to send information to each other over the internet. 
- For example, the way in which an email is formatted, forwarded, and received by all devices is done according to a standard.
