# Communication Protocols

- Before beginning to communicate with each other, we establish rules or agreements to govern the conversation.
- These agreements include the following:

    - What method of communication should we use?
    - What language should we use?
    - Do we need to confirm that our messages are received?

- These rules, or protocols, must be followed in order for the message to be successfully delivered and understood.
- Among the protocols that govern successful human communication are these: 

  - An identified sender and receiver
  - Agreed upon method of communicating (face-to-face, telephone, letter, photograph)
  - Common language and grammar
  - Speed and timing of delivery
  - Confirmation or acknowledgment requirements
