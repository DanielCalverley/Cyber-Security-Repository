# Ethernet MAC Address

- All communication requires a way to identify the source and destination. 
- The source and destination in human communication are represented by names.

- When your name is called, you listen to the message and respond. 
- Other people in the room may hear the message, but they ignore it because it is not addressed to them.

- On Ethernet networks, a similar method exists for identifying source and destination hosts. 
- Each host connected to an Ethernet network is assigned a physical address which serves to identify the host on the network.

- Every Ethernet network interface has a physical address assigned to it when it is manufactured. 
- This address is known as the Media Access Control (MAC) address. 
- The MAC address identifies each source and destination host on the network.
