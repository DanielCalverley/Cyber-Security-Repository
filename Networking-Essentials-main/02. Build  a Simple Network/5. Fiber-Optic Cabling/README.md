# Fiber-Optic Cables

- Fiber-optic cable is constructed of either glass or plastic, neither of which conducts electricity.
- This means that it is immune to EMI and RFI, and is suitable for installation in environments where interference is a problem.
- Fiber connections are a good choice to extend networks from one building to another, both because of distance considerations and because fiber cables are more resistant to outdoor environmental conditions than copper cables.
- Each fiber-optic circuit is actually two fiber cables. One is used to transmit data; the other is used to receive data.

# Parts of fiber-optic cable

**1. Jacket:** Typically a PVC jacket that protects the fiber against abrasion, moisture, and other contaminants. This outer jacket composition can vary depending on the cable usage.
**2. Strenghtening Material:** Surrounds the buffer, prevents the fiber cable from being stretched when it is being pulled. The material used is often the same material used to produce bulletproof vests.
**3. Buffer:** Used to help shield the core and cladding from damage.
**4. Cladding:** Made from slightly different chemicals than those used to create the core. It tends to act like a mirror by reflecting light back into the core of the fiber. This keeps light in the core as it travels down the fiber.
**5. Core:** The core is actually the light transmission element at the center of the optical fiber. This core is typically silica or glass. Light pulses travel through the fiber core.

- Bandwidth on fiber-optic links can reach speeds of 100 Gbps and is continually increasing as standards are developed and adopted.
- Fiber-optic links are found in many corporations and are also used to connect ISPs on the internet.
