# Types of Twisted-Pair Cables

## 1. Unshielded twisted-pair

- UTP cable is inexpensive, offers a high bandwidth, and is easy to install.
- This type of cable is used to connect workstations, hosts and network devices.
- It can come with many different numbers of pairs inside the jacket, but the most common number of pairs is four.
- Each pair is identified by a specific color code. 

## 2. Shielded twisted-pair

- There are electrical environments in which EMI and RFI are so strong that shielding is a requirement to make communication possible, such as in a factory.
- In this instance, it may be necessary to use a cable that contains shielding, such as shielded twisted-pair (STP).
- Unfortunately, STP cables are very expensive, not as flexible, and have additional requirements because of the shielding that make them difficult to work with. 

## Commonly used UTPs

| Category | Speed | Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cat 3 UTP | 10 Mbps at 16 MHz | 1. Suitable for Ethernet LANs <br/> 2. Most often used for phone lines |
| Cat 5 UTP | 100 Mbps at 100 MHz | Manufactured with higher standard than Cat 3 to allow higher data transfer rates |
| Cat 5e UTP | 1000 Mbps at 100 MHz | 1. Manufactured with higher standard than Cat 5 to allow higher data transfer rates <br/> 2. More twists per foot than Cat 5 to better prevent EMI and RFI from outside sources |
| Cat 6 UTP | 1000 Mbps at 250 MHz | 1. Manufactured with higher standard than Cat 5e <br/> 2. More twists per foot than Cat 5 to better prevent EMI and RFI from outside sources |
| Cat 6a UTP | 1000 Mbps at 500 MHz | 1. Manufactured with higher standard than Cat 5e <br/> 2. More twists per foot than Cat 5 to better prevent EMI and RFI from outside sources |
| Cat 7 ScTP | 10 Gbps at 600 MHz | 1. Manufactured with higher standard than Cat 5e <br/> 2. More twists per foot than Cat 5 to better prevent EMI and RFI from outside sources |

#
 - All categories of data grade UTP cable are traditionally terminated into an `RJ-45` connector. 
 - There are still some applications that require the smaller `RJ-11` connector, such as analog phones and some fax machines.
