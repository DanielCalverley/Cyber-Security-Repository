# Twisted-Pair Cables

- Twisted-pair cables consist of one or more pairs of insulated copper wires that are twisted together and housed in a protective jacket. 
- Like all copper cables, twisted-pair uses pulses of electricity to transmit data.
- Data transmission over copper cable is sensitive to electromagnetic interference (EMI), which can reduce the data throughput rate that a cable can provide.
- Another source of interference, known as `crosstalk`, occurs when cables are bundled together for long lengths.
- The electrical impulses from one cable can cross over to an adjacent cable. This occurs most frequently when cables are improperly installed and terminated.
- When data transmission is corrupted due to interference such as crosstalk, the data must be retransmitted. This can degrade the data carrying capacity of the medium.
