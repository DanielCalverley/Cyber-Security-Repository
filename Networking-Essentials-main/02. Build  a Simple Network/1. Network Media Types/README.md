# The 3 Media Types

- Modern networks primarily use three types of media to interconnect devices, as shown in the figure:
  - **Metal wires within cables -** Data is encoded into electrical impulses.
  - **Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable) -** Data is encoded into pulses of light.
  - **Wireless transmission -** Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves.

## The 4 main criteria for choosing network media are these:

    What is the maximum distance that the media can successfully carry a signal?
    What is the environment in which the media will be installed?
    What is the amount of data and at what speed must it be transmitted?
    What is the cost of the media and installation?
