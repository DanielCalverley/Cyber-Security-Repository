# Bandwidth

- Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data.
- Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time. 
- Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that (theoretically) can be sent across the media in a second.
