# Throughput

- Like bandwidth, throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time.
- However, due to a number of factors, throughput does not usually match the specified bandwidth.
- Many factors influence throughput including:

   - The amount of data being sent and received over the connection
   - The types of data being transmitted
   - The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination
  
- Throughput measurements do not take into account the validity or usefulness of the bits being transmitted and received. 
- Many messages received through the network are not destined for specific user applications. 
- An example would be network control messages that regulate traffic and correct errors.
- In an internetwork or network with multiple segments, throughput cannot be faster than the slowest link of the path from sending device to the receiving device.
- Even if all or most of the segments have high bandwidth, it will only take one segment in the path with lower bandwidth to create a slowdown of the throughput of the entire network.

## Latency

- Latency refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.
