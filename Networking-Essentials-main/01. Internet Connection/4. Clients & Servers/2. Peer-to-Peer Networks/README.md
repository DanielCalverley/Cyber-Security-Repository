# Peer-to-Peer Networks

- Client and server software usually run on separate computers, but it is also possible for one computer to run both client and server software at the same time. 
- In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the servers and clients on the network. This type of network is called a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.
- The simplest P2P network consists of two directly connected computers using either a wired or wireless connection. 
- Both computers are then able to use this simple network to exchange data and services with each other, acting as either a client or a server as necessary.
- Multiple PCs can also be connected to create a larger P2P network, but this requires a network device, such as a switch, to interconnect the computers.
- The main disadvantage of a P2P environment is that the performance of a host can be slowed down if it is acting as both a client and a server at the same time. 
- The figure lists some of the advantages and disadvantages of peer-to-peer networks.

- In larger businesses, because of the potential for high amounts of network traffic, it is often necessary to have dedicated servers to support the number of service requests.

## Advantages of P2P networking

- Easy to up
- Less complex
- Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required
- Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers

## Disadvantages of P2P networking

- No centralized administration
- Not as secure
- All devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow their performance
