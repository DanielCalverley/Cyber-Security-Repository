# There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks: 

## 1. Electricl Signals

- Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.

## 2. Optical Signals

- Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.

## 3. Wireless Signals 

- Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.
