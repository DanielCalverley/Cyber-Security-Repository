# End Device Addressing

- To physically connect to a network, an end-user device must have a network interface card (NIC).
- The NIC is a piece of hardware that enables the device to connect to the network medium, either wired or wireless.
- It may be integrated into the device motherboard or may be a separately installed card.
- In addition to the physical connection, some configuration of the operating system is required for the device to participate in the network.
- Most networks connect to the internet and use the internet to exchange information.
- An end-user device requires an Internet Protocol (IP) address, as well as other information, to identify it to the other devices in the network.


- **There are three parts to the IP configuration which must be correct for the device to send and receive information on the network:**

**1. IP Address:** This identifies the host on the network.\
**2. Subnet Mask:**  This is used to identify the network on which the host is connected.\
**3. Default Gateway:**  This identifies the networking device that the host uses to access the internet or another remote network.

### Note:

- Most network applications use a domain name, such as www.cisco.com, instead of an IP address when accessing information on the internet.
- A DNS server is used to translate the domain name to its IP address.
- Without an IP address of a DNS server, the user will have difficulty accessing the internet.
