# Mobile Devices

- The internet connects more computing devices than just desktop and laptop computers. 
- There are devices all around that you may interact with on a daily basis that are also connected to the internet. 
- These include mobile devices, home devices, and a variety of other connected devices.

## **1. Smartphone**

- Smartphones are able to connect to the Internet from almost anywhere. Smart phones combine the functions of many different products together, such as a telephone, camera, GPS receiver, media player, and touch screen computer.

## **2. Tablet**

- Tablets, like smartphones, also have the functionality of multiple devices. With the additional screen size, they are ideal for watching videos and reading magazines or books. With on-screen keyboards, users are able to do many of the things they used to do on their laptop computer, such as composing emails or browsing the web.

## **3. Smartwatch**

- A smartwatch can connect to a smart phone to provide the user with alerts and messages. Additional functions, such as heart rate monitoring and counting steps, like a pedometer, can help people who are wearing the device to track their health. 

## **4. Smart Glasses**

- A wearable computer in the form of glasses, such as Google Glass, contains a tiny screen that displays information to the wearer in a similar fashion to the Head-Up Display (HUD) of a fighter pilot. A small touch pad on the side allows the user to navigate menus while still being able to see through the smart glasses.
