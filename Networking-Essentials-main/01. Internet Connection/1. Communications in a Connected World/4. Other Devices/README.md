# Other Devices

## 1. Smart Cars

- Many modern cars can connect to the Internet to access maps, audio and video content, or information about a destination. They can even send a text message or email if there is an attempted theft or call for assistance in case of an accident. These cars can also connect to smart phones and tablets to display information about the different engine systems, provide maintenance alerts, or display the status of the security system.

## 2. RFID

- Radio frequency identification (RFIDs) tags can be placed in or on objects to track them or monitor sensors for many conditions.

## 3. Sensors and Actuators

- Connected sensors can provide temperature, humidity, wind speed, barometric pressure, and soil moisture data.
- Actuators can then be automatically triggered based on current conditions.
- For example, a smart sensor can periodically send soil moisture data to a monitoring station. 
- The monitoring station can then send a signal to an actuator to begin watering.
- The sensor will continue to send soil moisture data allowing the monitoring station to determine when to deactivate the actuator.

## 4. Medical Devices

- Medical devices such as pacemakers, insulin pumps, and hospital monitors provide users or medical professionals with direct feedback or alerts when vital signs are at specific levels.
